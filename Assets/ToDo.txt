Nut smasher edits:
-title screen of "smasing and nuts" coming together
-need to demonstrate goofy irreverence via game,
where does it exist temporally? how does it address 
the player?
- "lost minigame from 90s era game??"
- "consistently 90s"
-make obvious temporal influences, what is a 90s start
screen?
-loadover screen, "splash image" in player settings
-edit particle system w links that matt sent
https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/particles-texture-sheet-animation
http://glennmurphy.weebly.com/texture-sheet-animation.html
-have particles move less in depth space, dont go out towards camera as much, can be in a small range in depth axis
-convey "that its fine" that players missed a nut
-flickering .01% ballsack mode (kudos to ali)
-evolution mode (kudos to finn)
-insult mode: every time the player misses, the hammer and nuts insult the player (kudos to ali)
